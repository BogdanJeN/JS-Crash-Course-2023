// Request userâ€™s data and show the results by using prompt() and alert() dialogs.

    // question 1
// 1. Request the birth year from the user and show his age. Use a constant in this code.


const CURRENT_YEAR = 2023; // set a constant for the current year
let birthYear = prompt("What year were you born in?"); // prompt the user for their birth year
let age = CURRENT_YEAR - birthYear; // calculate the user's age

    // question 2
// 2. Ask the user for the radius of a circle and display its area.


let radius = prompt("Enter the radius of the circle:");
let area = Math.PI * radius ** 2;
